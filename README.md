# JavaScript Learning Repository

Welcome to my JavaScript Learning Repository! This repository is designed to help me keep track of my learning progress and notes on various JavaScript topics from the Udemy course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. Each branch in this repository corresponds to a specific topic and contains a `README.md` file with detailed notes and information about that topic.
